<h1 class="text-left" id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p class="text-left">The NASA-Sloan Atlas sample was selected to
include virtually all known redshifts of local galaxies within the
imaging coverage of the SDSS.  The latest version extends
to <var>z&lt;0.15</var> for galaxies within 
<a href="http://sdss3.org/dr12">SDSS DR12</a>. For each such galaxy,
we have created image mosaics from SDSS and GALEX and rephotometered
the <var>ugriz</var> bands plus the far and near ultraviolet bands in
a self-consistent manner. After cleaning a number of suspicious cases
the final catalog contains 641,409 galaxies.</p>

<p class="text-left"> This catalog is meant to represent an
improvement on the standard pipeline catalogs from either survey. In
particular, the SDSS standard pipeline oversubtracts the sky for large
objects, whereas our analysis avoids that issue.  However, there are
still existing errors that users should watch out for, listed in
our <a href="caveats">caveats</a>.</p>

<h1 class="text-left" id="catalogs">Source catalogs</h1>

<p class="text-left">The list of galaxies in the NSA was generated on
the basis of several
catalogs: <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/dr8">Sloan Digital Sky Server
DR8</a>, <a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/">NASA Extragalactic
Database</a>, <a href="http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/6df/">Six-degree
Field Galaxy Redshift
Survey</a>, <a href="http://msowww.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS/">Two-degree
Field Galaxy Redshift
Survey</a>, <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~dfabricant/huchra/zcat/">ZCAT</a>
and <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/index.php">ALFALFA</a> In
each case we restricted the sample to galaxies with heliocentric
redshifts less than 0.15 and did our best to exclude stars
misclassified as galaxies.  We combined the source lists and removed
duplicates.  In addition, we determined the SDSS coverage of each
galaxy and kept only those within the SDSS imaging survey.</p>

<p class="text-left">Each galaxy is given a unique integer (NSAID)
based on its position in this original catalog, which we use to label
each galaxy. Together with the NSA version (e.g. <code>v0_1_0</code>)
the <code>NSAID</code> uniquely identifies each galaxy. Note that some
galaxies are removed due to problems identified in the analysis, so
the <code>NSAID</code> values are non-contiguous. Also note that for
different major versions (e.g. <code>v0</code> versus <code>v1</code>)
the <code>NSAID</code> designations will be different.</p>

<h1 class="text-left" id="sdss">SDSS images</h1>

<p class="text-left">The SDSS mosaics used here are produced using the
sky-subtraction techniques described
in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...31B">Blanton
et al. (2011)</a>. They correspond to the data in Data Release
8. These have been shown to be typically well enough sky-subtracted to
handle galaxies with half-light radii of over an arcminute. </p>

<p class="text-left">The sizes of the images were determined based on
the estimated sizes and/or magnitudes of the objects from the source
catalogs. Occasionally these have proven too small, causing problems
with the derived photometry.</p>

<p class="text-left">The photometric calibration of the images is that
corresponding
to <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/algorithms/fluxcal/">SDSS
DR13</a>. It is described
in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151201214F">Finkbeiner
et al. (2015)</a>.</p>

<h1 class="text-left" id="galex">GALEX images</h1>

<p class="text-left">The GALEX mosaics used here were produced by David Schiminovich
based on GR6 data.  Some of the images do not extend as far as the
SDSS images do, but in virtually all cases they include all of the
intended object. They have been sky-subtracted using the standard sky
subtraction from the GALEX pipeline.</p>

<h1 class="text-left" id="distance">Distances</h1>

<p class="text-left"> For each object within 6,400 km/s we provide an estimate of its
distance corrected for peculiar velocities. We perform the correction
using the beta=0.5 linear prediction based on the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift
survey density field (Willick et al. 1997). </p>

<p class="text-left"> The results are stored in the columns of the master catalog:</p>
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item text-left"> <code>ZDIST</code>: redshift
corrected for peculiar velocity, in the Local Group frame of
reference</li>
<li class="list-group-item text-left"> <code>ZDIST_ERR</code>:
estimated error on redshift (assumes velocity dispersion of 150
km/s)</li>
<li class="list-group-item text-left"> <code>ZLG</code>: redshift in
Local Group frame, uncorrected for peculiar velocities</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-left">For objects outside of 6,400
km/s, <code>ZDIST</code> is simply equal to
<code>ZLG</code>. For objects inside, it is the distance which
maximizes the likelihood of observing that object under the model from
Willick et al (1997).</p>

<p class="text-left">Note that for very nearby objects there are
available direct distance estimates; we have not attempted to
incorporate those here.</p>

<h1 class="text-left" id="photo">Photometric analysis</h1>

<p class="text-left">The photometric analysis uses the detection and
deblending technique described
in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...31B">Blanton
et al. (2011)</a>, which is based in spirit on the SDSS photometric
pipeline
of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ASPC..238..269L">Lupton
et al. (2001)</a>. We first determine which pixels in each mosaic are
detected in the <var>r</var> band image. Each island of contiguous
detected pixels defines the "parent" object.  Within each parent, we
deblend into several different "child" objects. The primary
differences between our algorithm here and that of the standard SDSS
pipeline are: (a) we use constant templates based on the <var>r</var>
band image; and (b) we require much higher significance to deblend a
child as a galaxy rather than a star. These differences make our
implementation more stable for the largest galaxies.</p>

<p class="text-left">For the child objects, we measure them using some
of the standard techniques employed by SDSS. We measure their
azimuthally-averaged profiles and calculate circular Petrosian
quantities using the SDSS parameters (<code>PETROFLUX</code> in the
catalog). In addition, we calculate Stokes parameters, which yield
second-order axis ratios and position angles at the 50% and 90% light
radii. Other parameters measured are listed in the data model.  We
have also performed one-component, two-dimensional Sersic fits
(including the PSF in the model) that yield a Sersic index, half-light
radius, position angle, axis ratio and flux.  </p>

<p class="text-left">The most robust fluxes and magnitudes available
are from the elliptical Petrosian aperture photometry, a new addition
since that paper.  The definition of the Petrosian radius used for the
apertures is based on the SDSS r-band and is identical to
the <a href="testng.sdss.org/dr13/algorithms/magnitudes/#mag_petro">usual
SDSS definition</a> except using elliptical instead of circular
apertures. The position angle and axis ratio of the ellipses used are
determined from the Stokes parameters of the light distribution at
around the 90% light radius (as determined using the circular
Petrosian fluxes). Based on simulations, these magnitudes avoid the
dependence on ellipticity of the circular Petrosian magnitudes and
avoid the biases associated with the single-component SÃ©rsic fits
released in <code>v0_1_2</code>. They do have the expected dependence
of Petrosian magnitudes on profile shape, leading to an underestimate
of the total flux for pure de Vaucouleurs galaxies.</p>

<p class="text-left">We have also applied aperture corrections to the
photometry, to account for the variation in point spread function
between the bandpasses, particularly for GALEX. We do so by using the
measured curve-of-growth to predict the aperture correction for an
ideal elliptical galaxy, and applying this correction to the real
data. For GALEX, these corrections can be of order 30% to 50% for
galaxies with half-light radii around an arcsec; for SDSS they are
always negligible.</p>

<p class="text-left">We correct all the fluxes to the AB system and
calculate absolute magnitudes using the routines in
the <a href="http://howdy.physics.nyu.edu/index.php/Kcorrect">kcorrect</a>
package (<code>v4_3</code>). The inverse variances for each absolute
magnitude are listed; these include estimated distance
uncertainties. Note in some cases some bands (particularly far- and
near-UV) are missing; for such objects the corresponding inverse
variances are set to zero.</p>

<p class="text-left">After the analysis, the results are inspected to
remove catalog entries that turned out to be stars, which there are
some of, and remaining duplicates. The latter can occur when there are
several SDSS spectra (for example) off-center from the galaxy. </p>
